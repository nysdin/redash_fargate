#  This workflow will run every time you push to the main branch. It will sync the contents of the repository to the S3 bucket.
#  The  --delete  flag will delete any files in the S3 bucket that are not in the repository.
#  You can also use the  --exclude  and  --include  flags to specify which files to include or exclude from the sync.
